Setup the development environment
Open NetBeans IDE and create a new Java project with the name ElectricityManagementSystem. Now create two new packages with the name electricitymanagment and icon. Inside the electricitymanagment package, we will create all the Java files and inside the icon, we will keep all the images for the project.

Make sure you have MySQL server and Workbench installed on your system.
Download these two jar files and images.
https://sourceforge.net/projects/finalangelsanddemons/files/rs2xml.jar/download
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/

Now we need to add the dependencies of the project. Expand the project and right-click on libraries, click on add jar/folder and browse the two jar file you have downloaded from above and add them. You also need to keep all the images in the icon folder.
